# OLS Research and Impact Study

***Systematic evaluation of community development through open science training and incentivising contextual mentorship***

Wellcome Trust has awarded the Open Research Fund to Open Life Science (OLS). This will enable research and sustainability of the program for two years (mid-2022 to mid-2024). Under the title Systematic evaluation of community development through open science training and incentivising contextual mentorship in health research, OLS has received GBP 99,999 to create a funded position for a programme coordinator and researcher, as well as pay for the overhead cost for the next four cohorts.

The full proposal (personal information redacted) can be found on Zenodo: [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.5267934](https://zenodo.org/record/5267934). Below we share some highlights from the proposal and OLS plans for the next two years.

## Goals and Outcomes

Our main goal with this proposal is to conduct a research-based assessment, decolonisation and dissemination of our resources for their adoption and reuse across different open science communities. A successfully completed Open Research Fund activity in OLS will enable:

- research-based evaluation and enhancement of the OLS curriculum, training materials, mentoring formats and value-based approach to local community development,
- incentivised integration of contextual (sociotechnical and cultural) knowledge of mentors and project leads in the open science project they develop in the program,
- targeted support and equitable participation of health researchers and community builders from underrepresented communities in a shared vision for the global open science through collaboration,
- assessment of the long-term impact of OLS on the careers of the OLS participants and adoption of contextualised open science practices in research work in their regional contexts across low- and middle-income, as well as high-income countries, and
- publication of a series of reports capturing different outputs, building an open source evidence base and inviting support for the sustainability of OLS over the next 5 years.
